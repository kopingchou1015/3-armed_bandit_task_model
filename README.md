# 3-armed_bandit_task_model

These scripts allow the reader to simulate and plot behavioral data for the 3-armed bandit task using the active inference model described in the associated paper. They also allow the reader to import example data from a real participant. Finally, for either real or simulated behavior, they allow the reader to fit this behavior to the model, which includes the five parameters described in the associated paper.

Each of these options are available, with comments explaining their use, within the main_script.m file.
